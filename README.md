# Alisa Momin, Sonali Mahendran, Rice BIOE 421 Final Project

#Project Brainstorm:

#Draft title: Augmented Reality Description: We are really interested in working with facial 
#recognition and have ideas related to this: 1. We can create an augmented reality project such 
#as on Snapchat, where the camera can recognize facial features and adds filters that can follow 
#your movement. 2. We can create a program that can follow specific facial movements, or eye 
#movements as part as inputs in a computer game or use these movements to possibly move a 
#cursor.

#Project Abstract:

#Our goal is to design an interactive and engaging computer mouse for painting using the Circuit 
#Playground and a paint program such as GNU Paint/GPaint or Pinta. The Circuit Playground will 
#have 10 LEDs lit up with different colors that correspond to brush colors on the paint program. 
#The device user will be able to choose colors to paint with by tapping the capacitive touch sensor 
#nearest to the LED of the paint color he/she wishes to select. The user can then paint on the 
#canvas by physically moving the Circuit Playground in 2D space, like a computer mouse. The 
#Circuit Playground will take accelerometer data from the sensor and translate this into a painted 
#‘mark’ on the canvas. The user can then save their finished canvas as an image and overlay 
#his/her creation onto an image of their choice, similar to Snapchat filter usage. 

#We plan to use Raspberry Pi to link to the paint program software. We then will work to translate 
#the accelerometer readings into paint marks on the paint software. Then, we will implement the 
#photo-filter feature by using a Raspberry Pi camera to take images and facial recognition 
#technology to align the user’s painted creation to his/her facial features in the captured photo.  

#The significance of our device is that it is a fun, easy tool that combines multiple functionalities 
#and provides entertainment to children, artists, and photograph editors.
